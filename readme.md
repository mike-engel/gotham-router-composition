# gotham-router-composition

> A small example demonstrating one way to compose a router in gotham

Welcome! To read more, read my initial blog post outlining the idea on my [website](https://mike-engel.com/writing/router-composition-in-gotham). If you have ideas on how to make this better or find a bug let me know in the issues!

# Installation and running

This project is meant to be run on the latest stable Rust. I recommend unstalling Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs). Because of the small scope of this project, getting up and running _should_ only be a single command.

```sh
cargo run
```

If that was successful, you can now make a request to `http://localhost:7878/api/ping` and `http://localhost:7878/api/users`!
